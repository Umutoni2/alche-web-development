# HTML Advanced

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **complete web page** using **semantic HTML elements** only — without any CSS or JavaScript yet.  
It follows a Figma design to help structure the content logically and set the foundation for later styling with CSS.

The goal is to understand how to organize HTML files clearly and make every section meaningful and accessible.
